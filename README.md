## General info

This project I've made as my front-end path open ended project on Codecademy. It's a single page web application showing list of movies from a small [Notion database](https://www.notion.so/ac175d0f2a274aba8d750f0426369b43?pvs=21) I am maintaining.

Besides Notion API app is utilising TMDB API on movies' subpages. App is deployed on Netlify and takes advantage of it's Serverless Functions to handle some back-end like for example Nodemailer and also to hide my API keys.
